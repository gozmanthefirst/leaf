# Leaf

This is a monorepo containing the different parts of an app for writing and organizing notes called Leaf.

## Why?

I got the inspo for this from Obsidian. I think Obsidian is pretty amazing. However, I am poor and therefore can't pay for sync at the moment, and I'd really like to be able to edit a note on my PC and still access it on my mobile devices. I also wanted a solution that gave me more control over my data and allowed me to customize the features to my specific needs. Since I'm not such a bad software developer myself, I decided to build something similar, even if its just the basic features.

## Features

- Create, update, organize, and retrieve your notes.
- Organize notes into folders.
- Access your notes from any device with an internet connection.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Frontend Framework:** TanStack Start
- **Backend Framework:** Hono
- **Database:** Postgres
- **Deployment:** Docker

Other tools used include Prisma as the ORM layer for the database, Biome for linting and formatting, Husky for Git hooks, Lintstaged for running linters on staged files, and Resend for emails.

## Live Demo

- [API Base URL](https://api.leaf.gozman.xyz/api)
- [OpenAPI Docs with Scalar](https://api.leaf.gozman.xyz/api/reference)

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

2. **Set up Husky and Lintstaged:**

    ```sh
    bunx husky init
    ```

    After running the command, go into `.husky/pre-commit` and enter `bunx lint-staged`. It'll run any time a commit is being made.

3. **Set up the database:**

    - Create a `.env` file in `packages/db` and enter the DB URL:

        ```env
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:secret@localhost:5432/leaf
        ```

    - The database can be created using `turbo db:up`. Make sure you have Docker set up on your machine. It can be taken down using `turbo db:down`, and deleted using `turbo db:delete`.

    - Migrate the database using the following commands:

        ```sh
        turbo db:generate
        turbo db:migrate
        ```

4. **Set up the backend app:**

    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the `apps/api` directory.
    - Update the values to set up the environment variables. The required variables include:
        - `PORT`: The port the backend server will listen on (e.g., `8000`).
        - `FRONTEND_URL`: The URL of the frontend application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
        - `DATABASE_URL`: The same DB URL as the one set in the database package.
        - `AUTH_COOKIE`: The name of the auth session cookie.
        - `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: A secret key for encrypting notes. Generate a new secret using the command: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
        - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key for Better Auth. Generate a new secret using the command: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
        - `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: The URL for Better Auth, typically the backend URL.
        - `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key.
        - `RESEND_DOMAIN`: Your Resend domain.
        - `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key.
        - `RESEND_DOMAIN`: Your Resend domain.

5. **Set up the frontend app:**

    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the `apps/web` directory.
    - Update the values to set up the environment variables. The required variables include:
        - `API_URL`: The URL of the backend application (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api`).
        - `DATABASE_URL`: The same DB URL as the one set in the database package.
        - `AUTH_COOKIE`: The name of the auth session cookie.
        - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key for Better Auth. Generate a new secret using the command: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
        - `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: The URL for Better Auth, typically the frontend URL.
        - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google Client ID for Google Auth.
        - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google Client Secret for Google Auth.

## Running Locally

- Start the dev servers for the various apps and services using:

    ```sh
    turbo dev
    ```

    This will also start up the DB.
